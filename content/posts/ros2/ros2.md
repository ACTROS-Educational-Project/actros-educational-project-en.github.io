## Curriculum Name

Higher University Course in Robot Programming with ROS

## Information

### Basic Information

#### Presentation:

ROS (Robot Operating System) is the current standard in the area of ​​Robotics. So much so that it is essential in research in this area, and an essential requirement to access any job position related to Robotics. The learning process in ROS using the resources available on the web has a very high learning curve in the first months, so adequate training is required to guide you in this process. This course aims to respond to this demand, with an approach that combines theoretical explanations with practical exercises with real and simulated robots.

ROS2 is the new generation of this technology. It is a complete redesign to be widely adopted by companies that require features that ROS did not have (Quality of service, reliability, predictability, portability ...). This new redesign incorporates a multitude of new features and components that require specialized learning.

**This course has as an audience people who do not know ROS, and people who know it but want to learn the new ROS2 version.**

Our Robotics group is a pioneer in this technology in Spain, collaborating with this software, and being included as advisers in several European projects as experts in this technology.

#### Targets:

This course provides an introduction to this robots programming environment, covering all the necessary concepts and topics to carry out complex projects with robots

The course targets are:

* That the student is able, at the end of the course, to tackle a project using ROS2, be aware of the tools, procedures and good practices in this technology.

* That the student knows the evolution from ROS to ROS2 and the new features and resources it offers.

* That the student gets a general vision of the problems that exist in the Mobile Robotics and the solutions proposed by ROS2.

### Program (Studying Plan)

* **General Concepts About ROS2:** This section will address the main concepts about ROS2 and the main differences with respect to ROS2. The new features provided by ROS2 will be presented, such as its new design, its real-time communications based on DDS, and new concepts in ROS such as quality of services and Managed Nodes.

* **Perception with ROS:** Access to the sensors (camera, 3D-RGBD camera, laser, etc) and their usage with the OpenCV and PCL reference libraries. Basic behaviors creation for a mobile robot using this information source.

* **Navigation with ROS:** Configuring, mapping and start up of the navigation system with ROS2 in a mobile robot.

### Course Receivers

An Engineer degree is required. If you do not have this training, you can provide professional experience in the field of Engineering. Programming knowledge in Python / C ++ environment and Linux. **Previous knowledge about ROS is recommended, but not required.**

In the event that the number of applications exceeds the number of places offered, a selection will be made based on the following criteria: **Personal interview**.

* **Number of Places:** 12.

### Academic Direction and Faculty

* **Director and main professor of the course:** Dr. Francisco Martín Rico.
